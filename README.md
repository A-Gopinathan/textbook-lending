*This is a personal version of a team project.

This app provides an online system for lending, borrowing, and cataloging textbooks. 

Users are authenticated with Google and are able to request, add, and lend textbooks. 

The project was created with Django and hosted on Heroku.

My role in this project was the Requirements Manager:
- I oversaw the elicitation process, curating the targeted surveys and interviews to identify the targets for our app. 
- I produced a report containing user stories based on the data from the elicitation process, and converted these to Github Issues.
- I also contributed to writing core features and fixing bugs.
